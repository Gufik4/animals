My first project "Mini-Animal Atlas"

Used technologies:
- HTML
- Sass
- JavaScript
- React
- Jquerry

My target is to create this project, was learning the basics react, routing and download and send data to json server using fetch.
In addition, I wanted to train the basic functions JavaScript and reminder HTML, CSS and RWD.
I also tried using jquery and validating the form.
I did not focus on graphics and the content of the project.
